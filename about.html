    <section>
      <p>
        NIKSEN is a protest against the consumerist society where “being busy”
        is seen like a value if not even a virtue. This project questions the
        values of capitalist society and the usage of electronic devices like
        the smartphone by exploring the act of not doing anything.

        About the originator:<br>
        My name is Jabe Sverre Oost, I like asking questions, putting up
        metaphorical mirrors, playing with humour, irony and absurdism in my
        creative practice. I work with different mediums, mainly with:
        performance, photography, sound, audio-visual, writing, research and all
        other curious ways of making that cross my path.

      <h2>The NIKSEN Manifesto</h2>
      <p>
        Why we need NIKSEN in our lives:
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally speaking, our culture does not promote sitting still, and that can have wide-reaching consequences for
        our
        mental health, well-being, productivity and other areas of our lives. Technology doesn’t make it any easier: The
        smartphone
        you carry with you at all hours makes it almost impossible to truly unplug and embrace idleness. (New York
        Times, 'The Case for Doing Nothing')
      </p>

      <h2>The ‘rules’ of NIKSEN:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a place where you can allow yourself to put away digital technology: no phones, internet or screens
        </li>
        <li>Enable yourself to accept to do NIKSEN for an undecided amount of time</li>
        <li>Accept the awkwardness of silence, the itch to do something, or the notorious FOMO (fear of missing out)
        </li>
        <li>Try not to think of work or productivity</li>
        <li>Try to stop consuming, or to fetishise busyness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What is NIKSEN to you?</h2>
      <p>
        Create a method for yourself to ‘NIKSEN’.<br>
        Your place, pace and time.<br>
        Doing nothing is okay and necessary sometimes.<br>
        Take time to contemplate, reflect on yourself, how you are doing.<br>
        When you start losing sense of time, you’re on the right path.
