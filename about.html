    <h1>About</h1>
    
      <p>
        NIKSEN is a protest against the consumerist society where “being busy”
        is seen like a value if not even a virtue. This project questions the
        values of capitalist society and the usage of electronic devices like
        the smartphone by exploring the act of not doing anything.

      <h3>About the originator</h3>
      <p>
        My name is Jabe Sverre Oost, I like asking questions, putting up
        metaphorical mirrors, playing with humour, irony and absurdism in my
        creative practice. I work with different mediums, mainly with:
        performance, photography, sound, audio-visual, writing, research and all
        other curious ways of making that cross my path.
