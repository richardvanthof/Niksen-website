        <h1>The NIKSEN Manifesto</h1>
        <p>
            Why we need NIKSEN in our lives:
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, our culture does not promote sitting still, and that can have wide-reaching consequences
            for
            our
            mental health, well-being, productivity and other areas of our lives. Technology doesn’t make it any easier:
            The
            smartphone
            you carry with you at all hours makes it almost impossible to truly unplug and embrace idleness. (New York
            Times, 'The Case for Doing Nothing')
        </p>

        <h2>The ‘rules’ of NIKSEN:</h2>
        <ul class="styled-list">
            <li>Find a place where you can allow yourself to put away digital technology: no phones, internet or screens
            </li>
            <li>Enable yourself to accept to do NIKSEN for an undecided amount of time</li>
            <li>Accept the awkwardness of silence, the itch to do something, or the notorious FOMO (fear of missing out)
            </li>
            <li>Try not to think of work or productivity</li>
            <li>Try to stop consuming, or to fetishise busyness</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is NIKSEN to you?</h2>
        <p>
            Create a method for yourself to ‘NIKSEN’.<br>
            Your place, pace and time.<br>
            Doing nothing is okay and necessary sometimes.<br>
            Take time to contemplate, reflect on yourself, how you are doing.<br>
            When you start losing sense of time, you’re on the right path.
